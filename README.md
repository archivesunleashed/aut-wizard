This is a browser-based tool that can help you create scripts to use with the [Archives Unleashed Toolkit](http://archivesunleashed.org/aut/). Use checkboxes and text-entry to create well-formed Scala scripts that can unleash your web archives.

You can use it on our website at <https://archivesunleashed.github.io/aut-wizard/build/index.html>. 

To install yourself, download this repository following this [link](https://github.com/archivesunleashed/aut-wizard/archive/master.zip), or you can use your command line to clone it like so:

```
git clone https://github.com/archivesunleashed/aut-wizard.git
```

To use the client, open your web browser, select "Open File," and select the file under `/aut-wizard/build/index.html`.
